**Do you want to add a new synonym or sentence?**

There are two ways, to do so. The easiest is, to just open a new issue
and wait until one of the project maintainer added your synonym or sentence to the project.

1. Create a new issue
    - create a new issue
    - fill out the template for synonym requests
    - submit the issue
    - your synonym will be added in the future

2. Add it yourself
   - Fork the project
   - Add your synonyms to the arrays in the `messages` folder in the `internal` folder
   - create a new pullreuest to the master branch
   - After that a project maintainer will merge it into the master branch
    
**Do you have a feature request?**

If you have a feature request, you will have to follow these steps.

- Create a new issue
- Fill out the issue template for a feature request
- Submit the issue
- After that a project maintainer will manage your request and the feature will be added
in one of the next updates
